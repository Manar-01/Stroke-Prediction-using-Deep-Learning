# Stroke-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains the code and resources for building a deep learning solution to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke. The project is designed as a case study to apply deep learning concepts learned during the training period.

Key Components:

Data Preparation: Includes scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
Model Development: Contains code for building and training deep learning models using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Evaluation: Scripts and notebooks for evaluating model performance using various metrics and techniques such as cross-validation.
Deployment: Resources for deploying the trained model for inference, including Dockerfiles and deployment scripts.
Documentation: Detailed documentation covering project overview, data sources, model architecture, training methodology, and evaluation results.
Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/manar-01/stroke-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd stroke-prediction
Follow the instructions in the README.md file to set up the environment, preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
